 What is the pomodoro technique?
 The Pomodoro Technique is a time and focus management method which improves
 productivity and quality of work. The name comes from a kitchen timer, which
 can be used to keep track of time. In short, you are supposed to focus on work
 for around 25 minutes and then have a well deserved break in which you should
 relax. This cycle repeats once it reaches 4th break â€“ then you should take a
 longer break (have a walk or something). It's that simple. It improves your
 focus, physical health and mental agility depending on how you spend your
 breaks and how strictly you follow the routine.
